#### Project Description
The project involves building a scalable ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) data pipeline using dbt, Snowflake, and Airflow. The pipeline automates data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration to create a robust and efficient data pipeline for analytics. Data from various sources is loaded into Snowflake, transformed using dbt, and orchestrated with Apache Airflow to ensure smooth execution and monitoring of workflows.

Project Goal
Develop an automated, scalable ELT pipeline to enable reliable, real-time analytics and reporting.
Leverage dbt for modular, version-controlled SQL-based transformations.
Use Snowflake as the cloud data warehouse for efficient data storage and query performance.
Implement Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration to schedule and monitor pipeline tasks.
Deliver clean, actionable datasets for business intelligence (BI) tools and decision-making.
Key Skills Required
Data Engineering:

Knowledge of ELT vs. ETL workflows.
Data ingestion, modeling, and transformation.
SQL Development:

Writing modular and reusable SQL queries for dbt models.
Optimizing SQL queries for performance.
Workflow Automation:

Designing DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in Apache Airflow.
Scheduling, monitoring, and managing task dependencies.
Cloud Data Warehousing:

Experience with Snowflake for data storage and analytics.
Configuring Snowflake accounts, roles, and compute warehouses.
Version Control:

Using Git for managing dbt projects and code collaboration.
Debugging and Error Handling:

Identifying and fixing issues in pipelines, transformations, or orchestration workflows.
Technologies Used
dbt (Data Build Tool):

Modular SQL-based data transformation framework.
Enables data lineage tracking and testing.
Snowflake:

Cloud-based data warehouse.
Used for scalable and high-performance data storage and querying.
Apache Airflow:

Workflow orchestration tool.
Handles task scheduling, dependencies, and monitoring.
Git:

Version control system for managing dbt and Airflow scripts.
Python:

Used for writing Airflow DAGs and custom scripts for task automation.
BI Tool (Optional):

Tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker can consume the transformed datasets for visualizations.
Pipeline Overview
Extract:

Load raw data from various sources (e.g., APIs, databases, files) into Snowflakeâ€™s staging tables.
Load:

Use Snowflake to efficiently store and organize the raw data.
Transform:

Apply data transformations using dbt:
Create staging models (stg_).
Develop intermediate models (int_).
Build fact and dimension tables in the marts layer.
Orchestrate:

Use Airflow to:
Schedule raw data ingestion into Snowflake.
Trigger dbt commands for transformations (dbt run, dbt test).
Monitor job execution and retry on failure.
Result
A fully automated and reliable ELT pipeline that delivers clean, transformed data in Snowflake for business intelligence and analytics.
Scalable architecture that can handle growing data volumes and new data sources.
Reusable and modular SQL models in dbt ensure better collaboration and maintainability.
Airflow ensures smooth task orchestration, error handling, and monitoring.
Reduced manual effort and increased data availability for analytics teams.
